## Purpose

Studying can be a daunting task no matter the scholastic level, and traditional flash
cards are time-consuming and exhaustive to create. Purchasing the raw materials can 
also add unnecessary expenses for students. To solve these problems, we created Flash
Carma. As students who regularly use flashcards, we designed Flash Carma to be an
easy-to-use, cost-effective alternative to traditional flash cards that won’t take
enormous amounts of the user’s time to create.
